<h1>14. Stay with your team</h1>
<p><strong>Remember how wolf survive in the jungle? </strong></p>
<p>They stay together and hunt together; the same rule applies here, do not try to become Rambo in Squad match. You need to stay together and help all your teammates during any battle. Remember, if you have better coordination among yourself then there are 90% chances that you will win the battle.</p>
<p>In a Squad match, you need to be protective and give covering fire when your teammate is surrounded by the enemy. You need to help each other with med-kit and make a wall against all team members who got hit by a bullet and are on knees. Remember, you got very little time to save your teammates when you get hit by bullets. So, make sure in a free fire that you did not ward away from your teammates as it will be difficult to get or give help in time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: the main important factor in the team is coordination, keep talking with each other and help all members in the time of the battle.</em></strong></p>
