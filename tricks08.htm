<h1>8. Choose airdrop carefully</h1>
<p>AirDrop is great for getting rare game items with shields and other attachments. But you need to choose airdrop carefully, as this airdrop emits lights which can be seen by a greater distance. When airdrop falls from the sky, do not rush to them to get the loot.</p>
<p>Wait for some time and monitor if that portion is infested with enemy team or enemy. You need to take covers or shelter before you can monitor any enemy movement. <strong>Keep your glue wall handy when you rush to near the AirDrop</strong>.</p>
<p>Make sure to loot fast all the weapons and game items and run away from airdrop, so that you can hide and wait for other players, who will come to loot the air drops.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: do not rush to loot airdrop, instead wait and check if any enemy team is nearby and take cover while watching. </em></strong></p>
