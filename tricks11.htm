<h1>11. Check enemy location in Mini-Maps</h1>
<p>You can use mini-maps to check the enemy location; all the pro players always keep an eye on the map for the enemy position. Whenever any enemy fire on you or fire near you, his position being shown as red arrowhead in the mini-maps, now if you are conversant with the maps then you can clearly figure out from where the enemy is firing.</p>
<p>You can hide your location by putting the silencer in your weapon, which also creates less noise when your gun keeps on firing apart from that enemy will not get your location in mini-maps.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: You can also get the firing position of your enemy by selecting the ultra-mode from the setting which will enable you to see the firing bullet trail. Keep an eye on mini-maps for enemy position when they fire on you or your teammates. </em></strong></p>
