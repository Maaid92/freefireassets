<h1>6. Vehicle Vs. Trees</h1>
<p><strong>So, which one you prefer Vehicle or Tree? </strong></p>
<p>Well, both have pros and cons, and they serve a different purpose in the game. The vehicle is great killers when you wheel out from behind and knock down players. But these are mostly used when you are playing in lower levels when you advance to higher levels with most of them are heroic players, you will not get a single kill instead you will get killed instantly by all high levelâ€™s players.</p>

<p>Vehicles make a louder noise and will be shown in the mini-maps as yellow curve lines when using against higher level players they use glue wall to stop the car and kill the driver. Even teams set traps to knock down the car and kill the drivers. So, if you are playing at higher levels like the rank game then avoid cars and keep your self-hiding behind the tree.</p>
