<h1>10. Keep an eye on the Mini-Maps</h1>
<p>Mini-maps are like your third eye; you need to check it every time for your movement along with your teammateâ€™s movements. Mini-maps are used to check many things, some of them are as follows</p>
<ul><li>Check Movement of your teammates</li>
<li>Check enemy location when they fire on you</li>
<li>Review the safe zone position in mini-maps</li>
<li>Check Vehicle position in mini-maps</li>
<li>Check Danger area in mini-maps</li>
<li>Verify UAV position in mini-maps</li>
<li>Check your Loot in mini-maps</li>
<li>If any team member is using Moco character, then the enemy location will be shown in the red dot for 3 seconds when she shot an enemy with a bullet.</li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Pro tips: always keep an eye on mini-maps for enemy movement, which can be captured by UAV. </em></strong></p>
