<h1>4. Get your Weapon &amp; Armor first</h1>
<p>What you do when you land on the ground after jumping from the airplane in the free-fire?</p>
<p>The first thing when you land is to run and pick up guns, no bags, no armor, no med-kits. It is the only weapon what you need to pick, bags, armor or med-kits can be pick later, but first, you need to concentrate on the survival of the first few minutes. If you have landed in a very crowded place like peak or mills, then you need to pick weapon first to save yourself.</p>
<p>Getting guns should be your priority then you can go for Armor or bags or med-kits. Do not greedy take all different type of ammo, check your bag occasionally for the useless items such as ammo of different weapon which you don’t possess — more than one attachment of weapon, more than one scope, more than 10 med-kits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: chose guns over any other game items in the first few minutes when the game starts. </em></strong></p>
