<h1>15. Eat Mushroom to get extra EP or Life</h1>
<p>Apart from game med-kits you can also get an extra life called EP. These can be very helpful when your health gets depleted or when you did not have med-kits to full your health bar. Mushroom is the game items which are freely available in the game can be used to get extra EP.</p>
<p>EP is shown as Extra bar over the health bar and will automatically fill your health bar when it is empty. The only problem with EP is the rate by which it gets a transfer to Health bar; it is very slow. So, when you are in the game, do not wait for the EP to full your health bar and use med-kit immediately to avoid any casualty.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: Iff you own Miguel Character then you can expect free EP with every kill, or you can increase your EP when you eat a mushroom. so do not leave the red mushroom and keep on eating them to maintain your EP bar. </em></strong></p>
