<h1>9. Correct Weapon Combination</h1>
<p>One of deciding factor to win in any Garena free fire battle is the use of a correct weapon. If you are not using the current weapon in the current range, you will defiantly be going to lose the battle or get killed.</p>
<p>Always remember, when you are fighting one to one in close range then SMG and shotguns are the best weapons. When you are fighting for mid-range and long-range then you should depend on Assault Rifles, do not use SMG in mid-range or long range because it will not do any harm to the enemy.</p>
<p>Sniper Rifle is used for long distance range and that too when the enemy is static. Do not use Sniper Rifle when the enemy is in motion or running while jumping. You will never get a hit with Sniper Rifle. Instead, use Assault Rifles when the enemy is running away or jumping while running.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: Always use the correct combination of the weapon when you are playing Battle Royale Garena Free Fire. </em></strong></p>
