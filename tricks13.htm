<h1>13. Remember the thumb rule</h1>
<p>Remember the thumb rule, “higher position always wins.” If you ever server army, then you must know one thumb rule, a higher position always wins. This rule is true for Battle Royale Free Fire game. If you are holding on a higher position, there are chances that you will win 90% of all matches; the rest 10% depends on the enemy shooting accuracy.</p>
<p>So, whenever you get chance, try to capture the higher position, the best time to capture higher grounds are when the safe zone is shrinking, and there are fewer people remaining in the game.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: Always use Glue wall when you are holding in the higher ground, as you don’t have protection in that terrain.</em></strong></p>
