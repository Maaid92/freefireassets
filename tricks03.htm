<h1>3. Change Your Plan according to Game</h1>
<p>You should change your game plan according to the level and game you are playing. There is three types of game plan which you can employ when you play Garena Free Fire.</p>
<h2>Killing Spree</h2>
<p>If you are playing normal Squad game and need to complete a daily task or veteran task or Elite Pass task, then you can choose this mode. In this, you will be in killing spree with your teammate or alone, as fear of dying is not applicable as this did not affect your ranking. You will live by the day to get maximum kills and will clear all the task ahead of the day.</p>
<h2>Fire and Hide</h2>
<p>This type of tactics is used when you are playing for the rank game and with your teammates or duo. You can use this tactic when you are alone also in the rank game. All you need to do is not to expose your self for the incoming damages from an enemy bullet. You will fire and then hide behind your shelter or tree, creating confusion for the enemy and they will try to come out to check from where they get the hit. At that time, you will pounce upon them with heavy firing.</p>
<h2>Evading and surviving</h2>
<p>One of the timidest ways of pushing rank is to evade anyone to one battle with anyone till the end to push rank. All you have to do is to hide in any room or obstacle till the end to fight with the last one or the last bunch. This method is used by many players who want to push their rank from bottom to heroic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tips: there is no shame for choosing to evade and surviving when you want to push your rank. Choose any of the three different styles of the game according to the game you are playing.</em></strong></p>
